# New Market Analysis

By Beverly Huang

### Business Understanding
As an on-demand delivery platform connecting “Jumpmen” and customers purchasing a variety of goods, Jumpman23 is growing fast and has just launched in its newest market in New York City. This project will explore the delivery data to understand the market condition in New York City and extract insights for business action.

### Data Preparation
Before analyzing the data, I first examined the data integrity issues.I checked for both duplicates and missing values.

### Data Exploration
I examined the reasons for long delivery. To summarize my findings, the long delivery time was caused by the distance between pickup and dropoff locations, different processing time of merchants, and the mismatch between demand and supply of Jumpmen during different days and time of the day.

### Solution
To solve the problem, I proposed building a dashboard to monitor the real-time market condition. This dashboard will serve two functions. First, the
dashboard gives an overview
of the market condition in New
York City – market size (number of customers, Jumpmen and deliveries within a time period), popular places and items, share of each vehicle types, delivery time, time patterns of delivery amount, and pickup-dropoff heat map during different time of day and day of week.

More importantly, the dashboard can filter the day of week and time of the day, and then see the distribution of pickup-dropoff locations at the same time period. This information will be very useful for Jumpmen allocation and route optimization to reduce delivery time and increase customer satisfaction.
